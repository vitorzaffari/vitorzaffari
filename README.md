## Hey there, I'm Vitor! 👋

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on web development. My journey into programming began in 2022. Since then, I've been honing my skills and exploring new technologies, especially React.

### 🚀 What I'm passionate about:

- Front-end Development: Creating delightful and responsive user interfaces using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React.

- Back-end Development: Building robust and scalable server-side applications using Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB.

- Full Stack Development: Merging the power of front-end and back-end technologies to create end-to-end solutions that deliver seamless user experiences.


### 🌱 What I'm currently learning:

I believe in the importance of continuous learning. Currently, I'm diving deeper into the MERN stack to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
